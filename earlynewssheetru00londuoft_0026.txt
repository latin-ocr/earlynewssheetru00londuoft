army of 70,000 Poles, commanded by Kourbsszy and Rad-
zivit‚ invaded Ruffia from the fide of Polosk, whilst Dewlet

Gherai, Khan ofthe Crimea, at the head 0f60‚000 Tartars‚
penetrated into the province of Riaisan3 after an unsuccessful
siege of the capital of that province, the Khan retreated on
receiving the news that the Ruffians were preparing to attack
him. The expedition commanded by Kourbski and Rad-
zivit was equally unsuccessfu]‚ and the following year an
armistice was concluded for three years,

Neither of the two powers had obtained any advantage,
but thousands of houses were desolate, and thousands of

families had a gap in them.
And the Poles then as now were a pitiful instance of the

truth of Virgil's line:
“ Qidquid delirant reges, plec'tuntur Achivi.”
