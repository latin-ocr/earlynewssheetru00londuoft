Introduffz‘ion. 7

Adriatic, the contents of its cargo, the price of com-
modities abroad‚ together with some account of the
new issand,1 its wonderful people and marvellous
products, would form the staple of the news-sheet

of the hour. This document was in manuscript,

¹ The earliest accounts of the discoveries of Columbus were
given in little books of a few pages, very similar to those quaint
eight-page relations of our own Civil War, which recorded
the defeat at Naseby, the victory at Edgehill, the death of
Charles outfide Whitehall, and the other great events of the
hour. It is a singular fa& that the substance of all these “re-
lations‚'' whether a barn he burnt “ by accident of a soldier's
fireing‚'' or 5,000 men ssain and half a town levelled to the
ground, was invariably given in eight pages of small quarto.
In turning over a bundle of these “ Intelligencers,’' it is amusing
to note that when the newsmonger was more ignorant than
usual, and could neither find words to amplify his material,
nor any additional news to insert, he generally gave the sub-
stance of the first page over again on the last, enforcing it with
repeated ejaculations of “ may the Lord help us‚'' “ O trust in
God, ye hypocrites,” ‘⁵ may the ever-bleffed God affist us all‚”

“ Arnen, Amen,’' and such like.
