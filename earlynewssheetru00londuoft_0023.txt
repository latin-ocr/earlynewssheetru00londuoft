affault of the town of Kioff, fituated in another
distri& of Poland3 the which town, because it is
fituated on the river Dnieper, seemed most oppor-
tune to them for cutting off the provisions from
the whole of that distri& whereby the enemy
hoped, that by these means it would come to pass,
that all the other places in the neighbourhood, as
in the former expedition, would fall into their hands,
and become their property, for evermore.

For this reason they began by sending before them
four thousand of the six thousand Tartars which
were among them, into the deserts and wilderneffes,
who were to destroy every thing far and near by
fire and by sword, up to the very walls of the City3
imagining, perchance, that after having vifited that
whole distri& with such a calamity, they would

meet with the same good fortune in the siege of this

town as they had done before.
