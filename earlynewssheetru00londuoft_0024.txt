20 An Early News-Slzeet.

Amongst other things most dreadful to relate, the
Muscovite sent word unto the Polish king, that he
carried about with his army a Bier, such as those
used in burying the dead, which was made of filver,
and that he did not mean to make peace with him,
until either the King’s or his own head were placed
on that Bier.

The army with which the Muscovite makes this
plundering expedition, amounts (if report be true)
to two hundred and fixty thousand men and more.

May the most good and most great God' preserve
us from such a furious and cruel enemy, and instil
the right wisdom into those Princes of the Holy
Roman Empire, who have the government in their
hand8‚ and may He instil into the whole of Europe
such counsels as be most proper to revenge the

enormity of this crime and to drive away those

pests!
